# Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Activity Segmentation with Two-Path CNNs
In this repository we have developed a model to detect new MS lesions based on the paper: *Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Activity Segmentation with Attention-Guided Two-Path CNNs* (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895611120300732).

The architecture of the model is well represented in the following image:
